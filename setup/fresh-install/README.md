# Fresh install
This project aims to provide a way of abstracting away the package manager of
some linux distros, as to ease the process of installing software after a fresh
install

Linux distros currently supported:
* gentoo
* arch

## Usage
```sh
./setup.sh -d gentoo -s pkgmgr -b mybuild
./setup.sh -d gentoo -s pkgmgr -g audio
./setup.sh -h
```

## Why?
Software might be organized in different ways depending on the linux distro,
for a couple of reasons:
* the software might be split in multiple packages
* each package might have a different name
* the list goes on

## How does this work?
Each distro has one or more packages associated with a software

`db.yaml` stores a list of all packages associated with most programs i use in
a per-distro basis

For example, a program such as `gpg` is stored like so:
```
    - name: gpg
      arch: gpg
      gentoo: app-crypt/gnupg
```

This means that the package to install gpg in archlinux is called `gpg` while
in gentoo is called `app-crypt/gnupg`

The thing i want to install is `gpg`. The package which stands for
`gpg` in some distro shouldn't really matter to me after a fresh install

Therefore, `install.yaml` has a list of all programs i want to install (such as
`gpg`) and `setup.sh` allows me to query the exact package(s) that should be
installed in a certain distro in order to get that package

## Anything else?
Yea

`db.yaml` does not keep track of software only installed through package
managers. It can also work with software downloaded through other sources, such
as:
* `git`
* `curl`
* `flatpak`
* the list goes on

Programs can also be grouped in sets, for example:
```
  - name: texteditor
    pkgmgr:
      - vim
      - neovim
      - fd
      - ripgrep
```
The `texteditor` is a group which includes all of those programs. When querying
for the `texteditor` group, all of its items are going to be looked up in order
to name the packages associated with them


## Why not using only distro-agnostic methods of installing software?
I don't really use flatpak/appimages for all programs installed in my system
for many different reasons. Honestly, one day i might lay out all the reasons
for that, but to keep it simple:
* flatpak/appimage is great, until the integration with your system doesn't
work/sandbox breaks

My system is a mix of programs installed with:
* the distro package manager
* github
* manually with curl + scripts
* flatpak
* appimages
* other sources

So this project was my solution to deal with that mess
